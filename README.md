# calculator
this calculator that i made it with "c" is very simple and easy but it has somthing to do to run this code.

# solutions
you can run "main.c" in your vscode or codeblock without any problem but if you want to run "calculator.c",you should have "CS50 library" that i put it in here or you can use CS50 ide like CS50.dev.
